# SeekTalent Runtime Sequence

This page is a compact timing view of the active `v0.3.2` runtime. It complements [SYSTEM_MODEL](/Users/frankqdwang/Agents/SeekTalent/docs/v-0.3.2/SYSTEM_MODEL.md): the model defines the semantics, while this page shows the execution order.

### Notes

- Bootstrap freezes the requirement sheet and scoring policy before runtime starts.
- Runtime is frontier-based, not single-query iterative overwrite.
- A stop decision is still phase-gated; the runtime may reject it and continue into the next round.
- Artifacts are written as structured bundle data, not ad hoc logs.

## 2. Single Search Round

    participant Runtime as "WorkflowRuntime"

    participant CTS as "CTS"
    participant Rerank as "Rerank API"
    participant BranchLLM as "Branch Eval LLM"
    participant Update as "Reward / Frontier Update"

    Runtime->>Frontier: read open nodes + operator stats
    Runtime->>Runtime: compute phase(t), max_query_terms
    Runtime->>Runtime: build SearchControllerContext
    Runtime->>CtrlLLM: controller prompt
    CtrlLLM-->>Runtime: draft operator + args
    Runtime->>Rewrite: validate legality
    Rewrite->>Rewrite: optional GA-lite rewrite search
    Rewrite-->>Runtime: normalized controller decision
    Runtime->>Search: materialize SearchExecutionPlan
    Search->>CTS: search(query_terms, projected_filters)
    CTS-->>Search: raw candidates
    Search->>Search: deduplicate + project candidates
    Search->>Rerank: rerank(rerank_query_text, candidate.search_text[])
    Rerank-->>Search: scores
    Search->>Search: must-have / preferred / risk / fit / fusion
    Search-->>Runtime: SearchScoringResult
    Runtime->>Runtime: build rewrite evidence pool
    Runtime->>BranchLLM: branch evaluation prompt
    BranchLLM-->>Runtime: novelty / usefulness / exhausted draft
    Runtime->>Update: reward + frontier transition
    Update-->>Runtime: SearchRoundArtifact + next FrontierState
```

### Notes

- The controller does not own the frontier; it only chooses a local action for the active node.
- Rewrite normalization is deterministic after the LLM draft returns.
- Candidate scoring is `rerank + deterministic scoring + binary fit gate`.
- CTS returns raw candidates; sidecar projection owns deduplication and runtime audit tags.
- Reward update and stop evaluation are deterministic owners.

## 3. Timing-Critical Boundaries

- `RequirementSheet` is frozen before runtime; downstream stages should not re-derive requirements from raw JD text.
- `query_terms_hit(...)` is the shared text-match owner across selection, rewrite evidence, and scoring.
- Non-crossover search rounds execute a rewritten full query, not `parent query + appended terms`.
- `controller_stop` and `exhausted_low_gain` are phase-gated by the same runtime budget state, so a stop draft can be rejected without ending the run.
