# SeekTalent Target Company Discovery Design

Date: 2026-04-22

## Goal

Add target-company sourcing as a first-class retrieval dimension in SeekTalent.

The feature covers two phases:

1. Explicit target companies from JD/notes are available from the first search round.
2. When recall or quality is weak, SeekTalent can use Bocha web search plus a lightweight Bailian/Qwen model to discover relevant target companies, inject them into the query term pool, and run one controlled company-seed search round.

This is not a general web research agent. It is a bounded target-company discovery workflow that produces a structured `TargetCompanyPlan` and then reuses the existing controller/runtime/retrieval/scoring flow.

## Confirmed Decisions

- Use scheme A for flags:
  - `SEEKTALENT_TARGET_COMPANY_ENABLED=true` by default.
  - `SEEKTALENT_COMPANY_DISCOVERY_ENABLED=false` by default.
- Use the runtime-side `CompanyDiscoveryService` design. Controller does not browse, search, or execute external tools.
- Feature flags live only in high-level orchestration. Lower-level modules do not read feature flags.
- Target-company query conversion uses Top-K batch search:
  - accept up to 6-8 high-confidence companies,
  - search at most one company per round,
  - use keyword lanes by default,
  - do not globally apply CTS `company` hard filters unless the input explicitly says the candidate must come from those companies.
- Web search uses Bocha Web Search API.
- Web discovery LLM calls use the configured Bailian OpenAI-compatible `.env` settings with default model `openai-chat:qwen3.5-flash`.
- Bocha Tier 1 QPS is 5, so first implementation keeps Bocha search calls serial.
- First version does not add a new controller action.

## Non-goals

- Do not build an open-ended Deep Research agent.
- Do not let the controller perform web search or call Bocha directly.
- Do not add fallback provider chains for network failures.
- Do not add retry/backoff logic for Bocha failures.
- Do not make target companies a global hard filter by default.
- Do not rewrite requirement extraction, scoring, CTS client, or UI.
- Do not add database storage or a company knowledge graph in this phase.
- Do not introduce broad manager/helper abstractions.

## Current Repository Fit

The current repository already has the right seams:

- `WorkflowRuntime` owns orchestration, budget, pagination, dedup, scoring, reflection, artifacts, and runtime overrides.
- `ReActController` can only return `search_cts` or `stop`; it does not execute tools.
- `canonicalize_controller_query_terms` requires terms to exist in the current query term pool.
- `filter_projection.py` already supports projecting `company_names` to CTS `company`, but that is a hard filter path and should stay separate from target-company sourcing.
- `RunTracer` and per-round artifacts already make search behavior auditable.

Therefore target-company discovery should be a runtime-side module that emits structured plans and injects company terms into the existing query term pool.

## Hard Design Rule: High-level Routing Only

Feature flags must not be scattered through low-level code.

Allowed flag checks:

- in runtime bootstrap after requirement extraction,
- in runtime company-discovery trigger gates before controller planning or stop rescue,
- in public run config/artifact summaries.

Not allowed:

- `if settings.target_company_enabled` inside requirement normalization,
- `if settings.company_discovery_enabled` inside query compiler classification,
- feature-flag checks inside CTS request construction,
- feature-flag checks inside scoring,
- feature-flag checks inside controller validators,
- feature-flag checks inside Bocha provider logic.

Lower-level modules are pure units:

- explicit target extraction extracts when called,
- web discovery runs when called,
- Bocha provider searches when called,
- query injection injects when called,
- scheduler chooses company terms when called.

## Settings

Add settings to `AppSettings`:

```dotenv
SEEKTALENT_TARGET_COMPANY_ENABLED=true
SEEKTALENT_COMPANY_DISCOVERY_ENABLED=false
SEEKTALENT_COMPANY_DISCOVERY_PROVIDER=bocha
SEEKTALENT_BOCHA_API_KEY=
SEEKTALENT_COMPANY_DISCOVERY_MODEL=openai-chat:qwen3.5-flash
SEEKTALENT_COMPANY_DISCOVERY_REASONING_EFFORT=off
SEEKTALENT_COMPANY_DISCOVERY_MAX_SEARCH_CALLS=4
SEEKTALENT_COMPANY_DISCOVERY_MAX_RESULTS_PER_QUERY=30
SEEKTALENT_COMPANY_DISCOVERY_MAX_OPEN_PAGES=8
SEEKTALENT_COMPANY_DISCOVERY_MAX_LLM_CALLS=8
SEEKTALENT_COMPANY_DISCOVERY_TIMEOUT_SECONDS=25
SEEKTALENT_COMPANY_DISCOVERY_ACCEPTED_COMPANY_LIMIT=8
SEEKTALENT_COMPANY_DISCOVERY_MIN_CONFIDENCE=0.65
```

`SEEKTALENT_BOCHA_API_KEY` is required only when web discovery is actually enabled or triggered. Missing key should fail loudly rather than falling back to guessed companies.

## Data Model

Keep models small and close to usage. New models can live under `src/seektalent/company_discovery/models.py`.

```python
CompanyEvidence(
    source: Literal["explicit_notes", "explicit_jd", "web_search", "page_read"],
    title: str,
    url: str | None,
    snippet: str,
)

TargetCompanyCandidate(
    name: str,
    aliases: list[str],
    source: Literal["explicit", "web_inferred"],
    intent: Literal["target", "preferred_source", "exclude", "client_company", "holdout"],
    confidence: float,
    evidence: list[CompanyEvidence],
    search_usage: Literal["keyword", "keyword_and_skill", "holdout", "exclude"],
)

TargetCompanyPlan(
    accepted_companies: list[TargetCompanyCandidate],
    holdout_companies: list[TargetCompanyCandidate],
    rejected_companies: list[TargetCompanyCandidate],
    explicit_company_count: int,
    web_discovery_attempted: bool,
)
```

Extend query term literals:

```python
QueryTermSource += "target_company" | "company_discovery"
QueryTermCategory += "company"
QueryRetrievalRole += "target_company"
```

A company term looks like:

```json
{
  "term": "火山引擎",
  "source": "company_discovery",
  "category": "company",
  "retrieval_role": "target_company",
  "queryability": "admitted",
  "family": "company.volcengine",
  "priority": 20,
  "first_added_round": 2,
  "active": true
}
```

`hard_constraints.company_names` keeps its current meaning: explicit company-experience constraints that may be projected to CTS `company`. Target companies live in `TargetCompanyPlan` and enter search as query terms unless the user explicitly says they are mandatory source companies.

## Module Layout

Add one isolated package:

```text
src/seektalent/company_discovery/
  __init__.py
  models.py
  service.py
  explicit.py
  providers.py
  bocha_provider.py
  prompts.py
  page_reader.py
  query_injection.py
  scheduler.py
```

Responsibilities:

- `explicit.py`: extracts explicit target/preferred/excluded/client companies from existing requirement fields and simple JD/notes patterns.
- `providers.py`: defines a minimal web-search protocol and normalized `WebSearchResult`.
- `bocha_provider.py`: calls Bocha Web Search API using `httpx`.
- `page_reader.py`: fetches a small number of selected pages with `httpx`; records failures without failing the run.
- `prompts.py`: renders discovery LLM prompts for planner, triage, evidence extraction, and reducer.
- `service.py`: coordinates explicit bootstrap and web discovery workflows.
- `query_injection.py`: injects accepted companies into `query_term_pool`.
- `scheduler.py`: chooses the next company seed query terms.

The package should not depend on controller, scoring, finalizer, UI, or CTS client.

## Runtime Flow

### Explicit Bootstrap

After `_build_run_state` creates the `RunState`:

```python
if self.settings.target_company_enabled:
    plan = await self.company_discovery.bootstrap_explicit(...)
    run_state.retrieval_state.target_company_plan = plan
    run_state.retrieval_state.query_term_pool = inject_target_company_terms(...)
    tracer.write_json("company_discovery/bootstrap_plan.json", plan.model_dump(mode="json"))
```

If the plan has accepted explicit target companies, runtime should ensure the first retrieval validates a target-company seed. This can be a runtime override that builds a normal `SearchControllerDecision` with:

```python
[role_anchor, top_company]
```

This keeps target-company sourcing from being accidentally skipped by the controller in round 1.

### Web Discovery Trigger

Web discovery can trigger before controller planning, starting from round 2, after at least one retrieval observation exists:

```python
should_trigger =
    company_discovery_enabled
    and not discovery_state.web_discovery_attempted
    and not target_company_plan.has_usable_untried_companies
    and round_no >= 2
    and rounds_remaining_after_current >= 1
    and (
        latest.unique_new_count <= 1
        or latest.shortage_count >= target_new - 1
        or stop_guidance.top_pool_strength in {"empty", "weak"}
        or stop_guidance.zero_gain_round_count >= 1
    )
```

Stop rescue:

- If controller returns `stop`, top pool is weak/empty, and web discovery has not been attempted, runtime runs company discovery first.
- If accepted companies are found, runtime overrides stop with a company-seed search.
- If no usable companies are found, runtime continues with the existing stop/broaden behavior.

## Web Discovery Workflow

The web workflow is fixed and bounded:

1. Build a redacted `CompanyDiscoveryInput` from requirement sheet:
   - role title,
   - title anchor,
   - top must-have capabilities,
   - preferred domains/backgrounds,
   - locations,
   - exclusions.
2. Use Qwen 3.5 Flash to plan up to 3-4 search queries. The model outputs search tasks only, not company conclusions.
3. Call Bocha Web Search API serially:
   - endpoint: `https://api.bochaai.com/v1/web-search`,
   - header: `Authorization: Bearer <SEEKTALENT_BOCHA_API_KEY>`,
   - `summary=true`,
   - `count` from settings, default 30.
4. Normalize and dedupe search results.
5. Use Qwen 3.5 Flash to triage title/url/snippet/summary and select up to 8 URLs to open.
6. Read selected pages with `httpx`.
7. Use Qwen 3.5 Flash to extract company evidence from page text or Bocha summaries.
8. Reduce evidence cards into a final `TargetCompanyPlan`.

The model must not accept a company only because it is famous. Accepted companies need evidence and must fit the role as a talent-source company, not merely as a user of a technology.

## Bocha Provider

The provider is intentionally narrow:

```python
class WebSearchProvider(Protocol):
    async def search(self, query: str, *, count: int) -> list[WebSearchResult]:
        ...
```

Bocha response fields map to normalized result fields:

- `name` -> `title`
- `url` -> `url`
- `siteName` -> `site_name`
- `snippet` -> `snippet`
- `summary` -> `summary`
- `datePublished` -> `published_at`

Search calls are serial to respect Tier 1 QPS=5. No retry chain is added.

## Company Query Scheduler

The scheduler turns many target companies into small CTS query surfaces.

Rules:

- Max accepted companies: default 8.
- Search explicit companies before web-inferred companies.
- Within a source bucket, order by confidence, evidence count, and fit-axis coverage.
- Each round uses at most one company.
- Do not combine many companies in one keyword query.
- Default query shape:

```text
[role_anchor, company]
```

Later rounds may use:

```text
[role_anchor, company, strongest_core_skill]
```

The third term is optional and only used when it does not crowd out the company lane or repeat a family.

Avoid repeats:

- A `company.<canonical>` family used in `sent_query_history` is not selected again.
- Alias terms are not used in the same round as the canonical company.
- Alias retry is allowed only if the canonical term had zero recall and enough budget remains.

Default CTS behavior:

- company term goes into keyword query,
- no CTS `company` filter.

CTS `company` filter is allowed only when JD/notes explicitly say candidates must come from those companies.

## Controller Prompt Change

Keep the controller action schema unchanged.

Add one controller prompt rule:

> When target-company terms are visible and explicit from JD/notes, prefer at least one early target-company-backed search unless runtime has already executed one or the family produced zero gain.

Runtime still owns the deterministic company-seed override, so this prompt rule is guidance rather than the only enforcement mechanism.

## Artifacts

Add top-level and per-round artifacts:

```text
company_discovery/bootstrap_plan.json
rounds/round_XX/company_discovery_input.json
rounds/round_XX/company_search_queries.json
rounds/round_XX/company_search_results.json
rounds/round_XX/company_search_triage.json
rounds/round_XX/company_page_reads.json
rounds/round_XX/company_evidence_cards.json
rounds/round_XX/company_discovery_plan.json
```

Existing artifacts remain the source of truth for retrieval execution:

- `controller_context.json`
- `controller_decision.json`
- `retrieval_plan.json`
- `cts_queries.json`
- `sent_query_history.json`
- `search_observation.json`
- `search_diagnostics.json`

Discovery artifacts should store enough evidence to explain why a company was accepted, held out, or rejected.

## Error Handling

Fail fast where failure changes trust in the workflow:

- `company_discovery_enabled=true` with missing Bocha key fails loudly.
- Bocha request failure fails the run.
- Company discovery LLM structured output failure follows existing bounded output retry rules.
- Page read failure is non-fatal; record `read_success=false` and keep using Bocha result summary/snippet.
- Empty accepted company plan is non-fatal; runtime records the plan and continues existing controller/broaden/stop behavior.

No fallback model chain, fallback search provider, or hidden recovery path is part of this design.

## Testing

Focused tests:

- `tests/test_query_compiler.py`
  - company terms can be injected with `category=company`, `retrieval_role=target_company`, and stable `company.*` family.
  - duplicate company canonical keys are deduped.
- `tests/test_query_plan.py`
  - company terms are valid admitted non-anchor terms.
  - duplicate company families are rejected in one query.
- `tests/test_runtime_state_flow.py`
  - explicit company bootstrap injects pool terms.
  - runtime can force a company-seed round.
  - `sent_query_history` records the company query.
- New `tests/test_company_discovery.py`
  - Bocha provider builds the expected payload and normalizes search results.
  - search planner/triage/reducer can be stubbed with structured outputs.
  - scheduler picks top companies one at a time and skips tried families.
- Config tests
  - defaults match the confirmed flag strategy.
  - missing Bocha key fails only when web discovery is enabled/triggered.

No unit test should call the real Bocha API.

Validation commands:

```bash
uv run pytest tests/test_query_compiler.py tests/test_query_plan.py tests/test_runtime_state_flow.py
uv run pytest tests/test_company_discovery.py
uv run pytest tests/test_filter_projection.py tests/test_requirement_extraction.py
```

Run the broader suite if these changes touch shared models or runtime behavior more widely than expected:

```bash
uv run pytest
```

## Documentation Updates

Update:

- `docs/configuration.md` with target-company and company-discovery env vars.
- `docs/outputs.md` with company discovery artifacts.
- `src/seektalent/default.env` with commented or default values.

## Acceptance Criteria

- With `SEEKTALENT_TARGET_COMPANY_ENABLED=true`, explicit target/preferred companies from JD/notes can appear in the first retrieval as admitted target-company query terms.
- With `SEEKTALENT_COMPANY_DISCOVERY_ENABLED=false`, no Bocha call is made.
- With web discovery enabled and low recall/weak quality, runtime can trigger one bounded Bocha discovery workflow.
- Discovered companies are accepted only with evidence.
- Accepted companies are injected into the query term pool.
- Runtime can force one company-seed search after successful discovery.
- Company seed queries use one company per round.
- Target companies are not applied as global CTS hard filters unless explicitly mandatory.
- All discovery decisions and subsequent company queries are auditable in run artifacts.
- Existing non-company retrieval behavior remains unchanged when both flags are off.
