# Workbench Node Detail Layout Design

## Purpose

The recruiter workbench should make the real CTS and Liepin search process understandable to business users. The strategy graph is a workflow projection, not the workflow engine. CTS still runs through the existing runtime and flywheel/corpus stores. Liepin still runs through the protected worker, connection state, detail approval, and ledger. The UI must adapt to those backend facts instead of inventing design-only fields.

This spec covers the workbench UI, graph candidate read model, node details, safe resume snapshot projection, and recruiter-facing notes. It does not redesign the CTS runtime, Liepin worker, benchmark method, or multi-source execution policy.

## Current Code Facts

- CTS CLI/runtime already works and writes durable runtime/flywheel/corpus artifacts.
- `RunArtifacts` has `run_id` and `run_dir`; Workbench source runs currently do not persist the runtime `run_id`.
- Flywheel already stores `run_queries` and `query_resume_hits`, including `round_no`, `query_instance_id`, `query_fingerprint`, `lane_type`, `query_role`, scoring fields, and final candidate status.
- Corpus already stores `resume_documents` and `resume_observations`, including normalized text/sections, artifact refs, eligibility flags, and per-run/query observation metadata.
- `candidate_review_items` is for review/final/actionable candidates. It must not become the recall pool.
- `buildRunStory()` already creates graph nodes, but it currently depends too much on review items and idealized runtime events.
- `StrategyGraph` already uses `@xyflow/react` and ELK. React Flow is the correct interaction surface for pan, zoom, and local node drag. Pretext is not used for graph dragging.

## Layout

The workbench keeps the three-column shell:

1. Left session column.
2. Center strategy graph.
3. Right inspector column.

The left `岗位简报` is a fixed-height collapsible card. Collapsed state shows job title, session status, source count, JD preview, and notes preview when notes exist. Expanded state shows the full JD and notes in the left column.

The left criteria area is agent-first. Empty triage does not render blank textareas. The center graph shows `启动 Agent`; clicking it calls triage prepare and does not start sources. After the agent extracts criteria, the left card shows a readonly review card with `确认并开始检索` and `修改`. Textareas appear only after `修改`. Human confirmation is the default; bypass remains a configuration mode outside this layout change.

Source selection happens when the session is created and is represented by source cards in the left column. The graph and running notes do not show source filter selectors. The central graph start button starts the selected session sources through the existing session start API.

The right rail keeps the current workbench shape: business-readable `运行笔记` remains visible above the lower inspector, and the lower inspector has exactly two compact tabs:

- `候选人队列`
- `节点详情`

`候选人队列` is the default global shortlist. Clicking a graph node switches to `节点详情`. Node-scoped candidates appear in the node detail for the workflow node that produced, scored, approved, or aggregated them. Do not turn every candidate into a top-level graph node.

## Strategy Graph

The graph remains an interactive React Flow surface laid out by ELK plus local post-processing. ELK computes initial structure; the workbench applies domain-specific round-row layout after ELK.

The user can pan and zoom the full canvas. Nodes can be dragged locally to resolve overlap or temporarily organize a complex run. Dragged node positions are not persisted in this version.

The graph uses virtual content bounds, not viewport clamping. Long multi-round runs may extend beyond the visible panel; users pan/zoom to inspect them. CTS round nodes must not be clamped to the visible viewport bottom because that causes later rounds to overlap.

## Multi-Round CTS Layout

Multi-round CTS iteration is shown as stacked horizontal rows, not as a circular loop or a long single horizontal chain.

Each round starts again from the left:

```text
第 1 轮关键词 -> 召回 -> 评分 -> 反思
第 2 轮关键词 -> 召回 -> 评分 -> 反思
第 3 轮关键词 -> 召回 -> 评分 -> 反思
```

All `第 N 轮关键词` nodes are left-aligned. For `N > 1`, the keyword node has two incoming business edges:

1. From `需求拆解`, labeled as stable requirement context.
2. From `第 N-1 轮反思`, labeled as reflection-driven adjustment.

The graph may summarize lane information on the row. Detailed exploit/explore lane breakdown appears in node detail.

## CTS Internal Search Lanes

CTS round details are lane-driven. The UI must not invent fixed lanes.

The backend-owned fields are:

- `lane_type`
- `query_role`
- `query_instance_id`
- `query_fingerprint`
- query terms

Known lane meanings:

- `exploit`: main narrowing query path.
- `prf_probe`: candidate-feedback/PRF-derived exploration.
- `generic_explore`: fallback exploration when PRF is unavailable or rejected.

If a round only executed `exploit`, the UI shows one lane. If a round executed `prf_probe` or `generic_explore`, the UI labels those lanes in recruiter language. Unknown backend-defined lane values are displayed as safe backend labels and are not dropped.

## Source-Run Runtime Link

Workbench needs a stable internal link from a Workbench `source_run_id` to the runtime/flywheel `run_id`.

`source_runs.runtime_run_id` is added as an internal field. It is written as soon as the CTS runtime allocates a `run_id`, not only when the runtime completes. Normal session/source card API responses do not expose `runtime_run_id` and never expose `run_dir`.

Graph candidate reads use:

```text
session_id + source_run_id -> runtime_run_id -> flywheel/corpus stores
```

The CTS source-run lifecycle is:

```text
queued -> running -> runtime_run_id_attached -> completed | failed
```

`runtime_run_id_attached` is an internal persistence milestone, not a user-facing status. Completion must be idempotent. If a worker crashes after runtime/corpus/flywheel state exists but before Workbench completion finishes, the source run must remain recoverable rather than silently losing graph candidates.

The system provides a repair/backfill path for source runs missing `runtime_run_id`. The repair path may use Workbench events, source run jobs, artifact refs, or runtime metadata to reattach the link. If the link cannot be repaired, graph candidate reads return a scoped recoverable empty state with a business-safe reason such as `runtime_link_missing`.

## Graph Candidate Read Model

Workbench does not add a `candidate_graph_relationships` shadow table and does not copy the recall pool into `candidate_review_items`.

The graph candidate read model is generated from authoritative stores:

- CTS recall and scoring nodes read from `flywheel.query_resume_hits` and `flywheel.run_queries`.
- Resume display metadata reads from `corpus.resume_documents` and `resume_observations`.
- Final/actionable candidates read from `candidate_review_items` and `candidate_evidence`.
- Liepin candidate/detail nodes read from existing Liepin review/evidence/detail request state.

The API returns safe `GraphCandidateSummary` rows for the selected graph node only. It does not return full resumes or raw provider payloads.

Graph candidate reads are paginated and stably ordered:

```http
GET /api/workbench/sessions/{session_id}/graph-candidates?node_id={node_id}&limit=50&cursor={cursor}
```

Default `limit` is 50. The backend enforces a maximum limit. The response returns `nextCursor`, `totalEstimate`, and `truncated`. Cursor values are opaque and server-verifiable. Sorting is stable per node kind:

- CTS recall nodes: round, lane, query order, provider rank, then deterministic candidate key.
- CTS scoring nodes: fit bucket, score descending, then deterministic candidate key.
- Final nodes: final score descending, review status, then deterministic candidate key.
- Liepin approval nodes: pending first, then most recently updated.

`graphCandidateId` is opaque. It must not expose `runtime_run_id`, resume document ids, artifact ids, provider ids, provider keys, detail URLs, or filesystem paths. The server resolves it only inside the authenticated tenant/workspace/user/session/node scope and must be able to reject forged, stale, cross-session, or cross-node ids.

Minimum safe shape:

```ts
type GraphCandidateSummary = {
  graphCandidateId: string;
  sourceKind: 'cts' | 'liepin';
  sourceRunId: string;
  nodeKind: 'recall' | 'scoring' | 'final' | 'liepin_card' | 'detail_approval';
  roundNo: number | null;
  laneType: string | null;
  queryRole: string | null;
  relationshipKind: 'recalled' | 'new' | 'scored' | 'fit' | 'not_fit' | 'final' | 'detail_requested';
  displayName: string;
  title: string;
  company: string;
  location: string;
  sourceBadges: string[];
  score: number | null;
  fitBucket: string | null;
  summary: string;
  matchedMustHaves: string[];
  strengths: string[];
  missingRisks: string[];
  reviewItemId: string | null;
  evidenceLevel: 'card' | 'detail' | 'final' | null;
  detailOpenRequestId: string | null;
  canExpandResume: boolean;
  canMarkPromising: boolean;
  canReject: boolean;
  canSaveNote: boolean;
  canRequestDetail: boolean;
  canOpenProvider: boolean;
};

type GraphCandidateListResponse = {
  nodeId: string;
  items: GraphCandidateSummary[];
  nextCursor: string | null;
  totalEstimate: number | null;
  truncated: boolean;
  generatedAt: string;
};
```

Capabilities are backend-derived. The frontend does not guess which actions are allowed.

## Resume Snapshot Projection

Candidate cards show safe summaries by default. Complete resume content is loaded lazily only after the user expands an individual candidate card.

The UI uses a session-scoped graph-candidate endpoint:

```http
GET /api/workbench/sessions/{session_id}/graph-candidates/{graph_candidate_id}/resume-snapshot
```

The endpoint resolves the graph candidate to corpus/review state inside the authenticated tenant/workspace/user/session/node scope and returns a safe display model. It does not read from a Workbench-owned copied snapshot table.

The projection is allowlist based. It can include normalized profile, work experience, education, projects, skills, and safe source evidence text. It must not include cookies, authorization headers, storage state, CDP/WebSocket endpoints, provider account hashes, raw provider control payloads, auth-bearing provider URLs, or raw artifact paths.

Complete resume snapshots are allowed in authenticated UI detail views and benchmark/corpus storage. They are fetched only while the individual candidate card is expanded. They are not allowed in:

- memory rows
- session events
- SSE responses
- running-note payloads
- graph story payloads
- public artifacts
- ordinary logs
- persisted frontend query cache, `localStorage`, or `sessionStorage`
- frontend error boundaries, console logs, or test debug output

Snapshot queries use short-lived in-memory cache only. Session, workspace, or logout changes clear snapshot queries. Collapsing a card may leave a short-lived in-memory cache entry, but it must not be persisted.

## Node Details

`节点详情` renders structured payload first, then node-scoped candidates or approval cards where relevant.

Node types:

- `岗位`: job title, JD preview, notes preview, and source mode.
- `需求拆解`: must-haves, nice-to-haves, query hints, exclusions, and triage status.
- `第 N 轮关键词`: query terms, query label, search direction, and lane breakdown.
- `CTS 召回`: recall counts plus this round's recalled/new candidate cards.
- `CTS 评分`: scored candidate cards, fit/not-fit labels, score, and reasons.
- `反思`: summary, rationale, and next direction.
- `猎聘简介抓取`: scanned card count, unique candidate count, and related candidates.
- `猎聘候选人初筛`: candidate cards, score, source badge, and AI screening reasons.
- `详情审批`: detail request cards with approval status, budget impact, blocked reason, and approve/reject controls.
- `最终短名单`: aggregated review-backed candidates with final score and source badges.

Candidate cards have a fixed collapsed height. Collapsed cards show safe identity, title/company/location, source badges, score/fit bucket, short summary, matched must-haves, strengths, and risks. Expanding a card fetches the safe resume snapshot. A failed snapshot fetch is localized to that card.

Review-backed candidate cards expose review actions: mark promising, reject, save note, request detail, and open provider where allowed. Recall-only candidates are read-only except safe snapshot expansion when allowed.

## Liepin Detail Approval

The current global queue can continue to surface detail approvals while node detail becomes the richer contextual surface.

The `详情审批` node is an interactive approval surface. Pending request cards show the candidate summary, AI recommendation, budget impact, current detail-open mode, and `批准打开` / `暂不打开`. Approved/leased/opened requests show budget reservation and provider action. Rejected requests show that no quota was consumed. Blocked requests show the blocked reason.

Approving or rejecting invalidates detail requests, graph candidates for the current node, session/source cards, and the session list.

The approve/reject endpoints re-check scope, request status, budget state, and backend capability at mutation time. Frontend capability flags are display hints only. Double approve, approve-after-reject, reject-after-approve, and blocked approve are rejected or idempotently resolved without consuming extra quota. Ledger writes and request state updates are atomic.

Approval discoverability remains visible through:

- pending count on the left source card
- human-action-required running note
- badge count on the `详情审批` graph node
- session list pending approval badge when available

## Running Notes

`运行笔记` is a business narrative layer, not a technical log and not a node list.

The graph answers "where the workflow is." Running notes answer "what this means for the search."

Notes always show all selected sources and use source badges for source-specific entries. Entries are ordered by real time and may merge same-round/same-stage bursts into one business summary. Raw event names are hidden by default and only appear inside a collapsed developer log.

Good notes include:

- the round goal or query change reason
- recall quality changes
- scoring outcome and what it implies
- reflection conclusion and next direction
- Liepin serial progress, budget, approval, or blocked status
- human action required

Example:

```text
CTS 第 2 轮：用“实时平台 / Flink CDC”放宽搜索，搜到 8 人，3 人进入评分，1 人 fit。反思认为 Kafka 关键词过窄。
```

Clicking a note selects the related graph node and switches to node detail.

## Event Replay And Idempotency

Workbench events remain the durable audit stream for UI reconstruction. New or migrated events include schema metadata sufficient for replay:

- global sequence
- session sequence when a session exists
- source run id when source-specific
- event name
- schema version
- occurred/ingested timestamp when available
- idempotency key when the producer can provide one

`buildRunStory()` must tolerate duplicate, missing, unknown, and out-of-order events. Duplicate events do not create duplicate notes or candidate counts. Unknown event names are hidden from business notes and can appear only in the collapsed developer log after redaction. Legacy composite `runtime_round_completed` remains supported, but split runtime events are preferred.

## Failure And Recovery States

The UI must render recoverable states without exposing backend internals:

- `runtime_link_missing`: CTS runtime data may exist, but Workbench cannot yet link to it.
- `runtime_artifacts_unavailable`: the runtime link exists, but flywheel/corpus data cannot be read.
- `candidate_resolution_failed`: a graph node exists, but its candidates cannot be resolved.
- `snapshot_forbidden`: the user cannot open the selected candidate snapshot.
- `snapshot_not_found`: the candidate no longer resolves to a safe snapshot.
- `snapshot_redacted`: the snapshot was returned with sensitive fields removed.
- `detail_request_stale`: the approval request changed before the user acted.
- `detail_request_blocked`: budget or lease rules prevented detail opening.

Business UI shows concise action-oriented text. Developer logs may include redacted technical context.

## Privacy And Security

All candidate and resume data is tenant/workspace/user/session scoped.

Graph/story/event/note payloads contain only safe summaries and identifiers. Complete resume content appears only after authenticated user action against the snapshot endpoint. Logs and exception serializers continue using centralized redaction.

All new API routes use explicit response models and allowlist projection. Field-level authorization is enforced by construction: routes return only fields defined in the response model and never serialize internal runtime objects, raw provider payloads, exception reprs, or storage rows directly.

## Testing Requirements

Backend:

- CTS start attaches `source_runs.runtime_run_id` as soon as the runtime allocates `run_id`.
- CTS completion is idempotent and does not lose the runtime link on retry.
- A repair/backfill path can recover missing runtime links or mark them as recoverable empty.
- Session/source APIs do not expose `runtime_run_id`, `run_dir`, or artifact paths.
- Graph candidate API enforces tenant/workspace/user/session/node scope.
- Graph candidate API uses opaque candidate ids, pagination, stable ordering, and response models.
- Graph candidate API reads CTS recall/scoring candidates from flywheel/corpus by runtime run id.
- Graph candidate API reads final/actionable candidates from review/evidence state.
- Resume snapshot endpoint enforces scope and returns allowlisted display data.
- Complete resume data does not enter `session_events`, SSE responses, running notes, graph story payloads, memory rows, frontend persistent cache, logs, or error payloads.
- Detail approval approve/reject remains scoped and CSRF protected.
- Detail approval double-submit, stale status, cross-user, and budget exhaustion cases are tested.
- Event replay is idempotent under duplicate/out-of-order events.

Frontend:

- Empty triage starts with `启动 Agent`, not blank editable criteria fields.
- Prepare calls triage prepare and does not start sources.
- Confirm calls approve then start.
- The right rail keeps business `运行笔记` visible and the lower inspector has exactly `候选人队列` and `节点详情`.
- Source filters are absent from the graph and running notes.
- The global candidate queue remains the default shortlist view; node-scoped candidates render inside `节点详情`.
- Selecting a graph node lazily fetches graph candidates.
- Switching nodes aborts or ignores stale graph candidate and snapshot responses.
- Expanding a candidate card lazily fetches a safe resume snapshot.
- Resume snapshot queries use short-lived in-memory cache and are cleared on session/workspace/logout changes.
- Detail approval nodes can approve/reject pending requests.
- Pending detail approvals remain discoverable from global queue/source indicators and relevant detail nodes.
- Multi-round CTS layout left-aligns keyword nodes and uses virtual content bounds.
- CTS single-lane rounds do not invent explore lanes.
- Running notes do not expose raw event names and do not duplicate every graph node as a log line.
- Graph node interactions remain keyboard-accessible.

## Non-Goals

- Persisting custom graph node positions.
- Turning every candidate into a top-level graph node.
- Adding `candidate_graph_relationships` or `candidate_resume_snapshots` shadow tables.
- Copying recall pool candidates into `candidate_review_items`.
- Replacing React Flow or ELK.
- Introducing Pretext for graph interaction.
- Adding a third right-rail candidate tab.
- Changing source execution semantics.
- Exposing provider raw payloads in normal UI.

## Acceptance Criteria

- A recruiter can start with a JD, let the agent extract criteria, confirm criteria, and run selected sources from the central graph action.
- The graph shows selected-source workflow by default without source filters.
- Multi-round CTS returns each next round to the left side, aligns keyword nodes, and shows both stable requirement and previous-reflection inputs for `N > 1`.
- Clicking CTS recall/scoring/final nodes shows candidates for that exact node.
- Node candidate lists are paginated, stable, and do not overload the graph.
- CTS node details expose real exploit/PRF/generic lane structure when backend data exists.
- Clicking Liepin candidate/detail/final nodes shows related candidates or approval requests.
- Candidate cards are compact by default and expandable for safe complete resume snapshots.
- Detail approval remains usable from `节点详情`.
- Running notes tell a business-readable story across selected sources.
- Complete resume data stays out of memory, events, running notes, graph payloads, and public artifacts.
