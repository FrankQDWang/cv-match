# SeekTalent Runtime Sequence

This page is a compact timing view of the active `v0.3.3` runtime. It complements [SYSTEM_MODEL](/Users/frankqdwang/Agents/SeekTalent/docs/v-0.3.3/SYSTEM_MODEL.md): the model defines the semantics, while this page shows the execution order.

## 2. Key Runtime Semantics

- Bootstrap seeds are `root_anchor` branches.
- Post-bootstrap child nodes are `repair_hypothesis` branches.
- Root anchors remain open after execution and receive the latest branch evaluation and reward snapshot.
- Final output is reviewer-ready: shortlist ids stay, but candidate evidence cards and reviewer summary are first-class outputs.
- Normal stop semantics can end on `controller_stop`, `budget_exhausted`, `exhausted_low_gain`, or `no_productive_open_path`.
