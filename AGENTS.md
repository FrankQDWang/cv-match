# AGENTS.md

## Purpose

This repository is in active productization.
Optimize for readable Python, safe change velocity, and maintainable repository-scale structure.

Default to pragmatic simplicity, but do not preserve experimental-stage shortcuts once they start increasing maintenance cost, boundary confusion, or regression risk.

## Core Philosophy

- Bias toward mainstream Python clarity over imported pattern language.
- Prefer direct code over ceremony.
- Prefer the simplest design that remains clear at repository scale.
- Do not engineer for hypothetical future needs.
- Allow necessary abstraction when it improves boundaries, API stability, or collaboration cost.
- Reject speculative flexibility, architecture vanity, and no-payoff indirection.
- Keep internal failure behavior direct and explicit.
- Treat external boundaries, user-facing flows, and integrations more deliberately.

## Python First

- Write idiomatic Python, not Java/C# in Python syntax.
- Prefer module-level functions over classes by default.
- Only introduce a class when it holds real state, lifecycle, or identity.
- Never create `Utils`, `Helpers`, `Managers`, or similar junk containers for stateless code.
- Prefer simple protocols and direct interfaces over hierarchy-heavy design.

## Pydantic Usage

- Use Pydantic models where typed boundaries or structured input/output genuinely need them.
- Keep models small, explicit, and close to usage.
- Do not create model layers for architecture vanity.
- Do not wrap every internal value in a model.
- Add validators only when they enforce real business meaning or prevent a real bug.
- Do not add validation theater.

## Naming
- Use simple, literal names.
- Favor names that describe the domain meaning, not implementation trivia.
- Do not use clever abbreviations unless they are already standard in the codebase.
- Do not invent grand architectural names for small local code.

## Function And Module Design

- Prefer short functions with obvious inputs and outputs.
- Keep the main path readable top-to-bottom.
- Keep logic inline when extraction would only add indirection.
- Extract functions when it improves clarity, reuse, or testability.
- Keep module responsibilities legible.
- If a file becomes hard to reason about, split it by responsibility instead of stacking more local helpers into it.
- Do not add layers just to look organized.

## State And Mutation

- Keep state explicit.
- Prefer passing values directly over hiding state in broad containers.
- Mutate data only when mutation is the clearest choice.
- Do not simulate immutability with pointless copying.
- Do not add getters and setters without a real boundary reason.

## Abstraction And Boundaries

- Treat local simplicity as the default, not an absolute.
- Introduce abstraction only when it clearly improves ownership, boundaries, reuse across important paths, or API stability.
- Keep public APIs small, explicit, and stable.
- Do not leak internal storage or implementation details across modules without a strong reason.
- Avoid junk-drawer modules that mix unrelated responsibilities.
- Avoid circular dependencies. If modules want to know too much about each other, the boundary is probably wrong.
- Do not create extension points, generic bases, or extra indirection without real pressure behind them.

## Error Handling And Validation

- Fail fast inside trusted internal logic.
- Be more deliberate at external boundaries, user-facing flows, and integration points.
- Validate input where it changes user outcome, operator understanding, or downstream safety.
- Do not swallow exceptions.
- Preserve clear error semantics.
- Do not add fallback chains, retry logic, or recovery scaffolding unless the use case actually requires it.
- Reject both defensive-programming spam and careless boundary handling.

## LLM Structured Output Exception
- A bounded retry is allowed only when an LLM response fails structured output or schema validation.
- This exception is only for "the model answered, but the structured parse failed", followed by an immediate re-request.
- Keep it small and explicit. Prefer a single retry unless a task explicitly requires more.
- Do not extend this exception to network failures, tool failures, timeouts, rate limits, or generic recovery logic.
- Do not add fallback model chains unless explicitly requested.

## Comments And Docstrings

- Write comments only when the reason is non-obvious.
- Do not comment what the code already says.
- Prefer self-explanatory code over explanatory comments.
- Use short, factual docstrings for public functions or non-obvious behavior.

## Testing And Change Safety

- Productization work should consider regression risk by default.
- Changes to public behavior, failure modes, or critical paths should come with tests or updated tests.
- Tests should track real behavior, not ceremony.
- Do not make risky changes to important paths without verification.
- If code is stable and correct, do not churn it for style alone.

## Complexity Discipline
- Reduce unnecessary layers, wrappers, and indirection aggressively.
- Do not optimize for fewer lines if it makes ownership or behavior harder to follow.
- Prefer direct code over compressed cleverness.
- Remove dead complexity when it no longer pays for itself.

## When Changing Code

- Make the smallest change that fully solves the problem.
- Prefer surgical diffs by default.
- Preserve working code unless there is a real reason to change it.
- Do not rewrite large sections without need.
- Do not reshape stable code for style alone.
- If the current structure is actively harming clarity or maintenance, limited restructuring is allowed.
- When restructuring, improve boundaries and readability, not architecture theater.

## What To Avoid

- No enterprise architecture cosplay.
- No premature extensibility.
- No speculative generic abstractions.
- No fake base classes created just in case.
- No defensive programming spam.
- No configuration bloat without real payoff.
- No ceremony added just to look professional.

## Decision Rule

When several implementations are possible, prefer the one that is:

1. correct
2. clear
3. maintainable at repository scale
4. small
5. easy to evolve locally

If two options are equally correct, choose the less abstract one unless the extra structure clearly improves boundaries or long-term maintenance.

## Output Discipline
- For non-trivial feature work, start with a short numbered checklist before writing code.
- Do not produce large rewrites unless explicitly requested.
- When modifying existing code, prefer minimal before/after diffs.
- Keep explanations short. The code should carry the weight.

## Priority

- Practical clarity beats theoretical architecture.
- Repository-scale maintainability beats local cleverness.
- Readable Python beats pattern-heavy design.
- Working code still beats scaffolding, but stable boundaries beat short-term hacks.
