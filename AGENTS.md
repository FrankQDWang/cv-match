# AGENTS.md

## Purpose
This repository is a local experimental playground.
Optimize for fast iteration, low code volume, and immediate readability.

## Core Style
- Prefer the simplest working code.
- Prefer shallow, flat, boring structure over abstraction.
- Do not engineer for hypothetical future needs.
- Fail fast. Do not add fallback chains, graceful degradation layers, or speculative resilience logic unless explicitly requested.
- Trust upstream data and existing control flow by default. Do not add defensive checks everywhere.
- Every extra layer must justify its existence.

## Python First
- Write idiomatic Python, not Java/C# in Python syntax.
- Prefer module-level functions over classes.
- Only introduce a class when it must hold real state across calls.
- Never create `Utils`, `Helpers`, `Managers`, or similar garbage containers for stateless code.
- Avoid abstract base class hierarchies unless explicitly required.
- Prefer duck typing and simple protocols over ceremony-heavy inheritance.

## Pydantic Usage
- Use Pydantic models where typed input/output structure is genuinely needed.
- Keep models small, explicit, and close to usage.
- Do not create model layers just for architecture vanity.
- Do not wrap every internal value in a Pydantic model.
- Prefer clear field names and direct types.
- Add validators only when they encode real business meaning or prevent a real bug.
- Do not add validation theater.

## Function Design
- Prefer short functions with obvious inputs and outputs.
- If a function can be understood top-to-bottom without jumping around, that is good.
- If logic is only used once, keep it inline instead of extracting prematurely.
- Extract a function only when it improves clarity, reuse, or testability.
- Avoid deep call stacks for trivial logic.

## Naming
- Use simple, literal names.
- Favor names that describe the domain meaning, not implementation trivia.
- Do not use clever abbreviations unless they are already standard in the codebase.
- Do not invent grand architectural names for small local code.

## State and Mutation
- Keep state explicit.
- Prefer passing values directly over hiding state inside objects.
- Mutate data only when mutation is the clearest choice.
- Do not simulate immutability with pointless copying everywhere.
- Do not add getters/setters for no reason.

## Error Handling
- Fail loudly on invalid assumptions.
- Do not swallow exceptions.
- Do not add retry/fallback/recovery logic unless explicitly requested.
- Do not convert every failure into a custom error type.
- Add error handling where it changes developer understanding or user outcome in a meaningful way.

## LLM Structured Output Exception
- A bounded retry is allowed only when an LLM response fails structured output or schema validation.
- This exception is only for "the model answered, but the structured parse failed", followed by an immediate re-request.
- Keep it small and explicit. Prefer a single retry unless a task explicitly requires more.
- Do not extend this exception to network failures, tool failures, timeouts, rate limits, or generic recovery logic.
- Do not add fallback model chains unless explicitly requested.

## Comments and Docstrings
- Write comments only when the reason is non-obvious.
- Do not comment what the code already says.
- Prefer self-explanatory code over explanatory comments.
- Use docstrings for public functions or non-obvious behavior.
- Keep docstrings short and factual. Python’s own style guidance treats these as conventions for clarity, not ceremony.  [oai_citation:1‡Python Enhancement Proposals (PEPs)](https://peps.python.org/pep-0257/)

## Code Volume Discipline
- Minimize line count, but never at the cost of clarity.
- Shorter is better only when still readable.
- Do not introduce indirection to look “clean”.
- Remove dead layers, dead wrappers, and dead abstractions aggressively.

## When Changing Code
- Make the smallest change that fully solves the problem.
- Preserve working code unless there is a real reason to change it.
- Do not rewrite large sections without explicit need.
- Do not reshape the whole file for style reasons alone.
- If editing existing logic, prefer surgical diffs over broad rewrites.

## What to Avoid
- No enterprise architecture cosplay.
- No premature extensibility.
- No framework-shaped code when plain Python is enough.
- No speculative generic abstractions.
- No “base” classes created just in case.
- No defensive programming spam.
- No configuration bloat.
- No ceremony added just to look professional.

## Decision Rule
When several implementations are possible, prefer the one that is:
1. correct
2. smaller
3. clearer
4. easier to change locally

If two options are equally correct, choose the less abstract one.

## Output Discipline
- For non-trivial feature work, start with a short numbered checklist before writing code.
- Do not produce large rewrites unless explicitly requested.
- When modifying existing code, prefer minimal before/after diffs.
- Keep explanations short. The code should carry the weight.

## Priority
In this repository, local simplicity beats theoretical architecture.
Readable Python beats pattern-heavy design.
Working code beats elaborate scaffolding.
