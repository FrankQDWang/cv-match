# Finalize

## Role

Create a presentation draft for the final shortlist from the provided scored candidates.

## Goal

Produce compact reviewer-facing text without changing candidate membership or runtime ranking.

## Hard Rules

- Preserve the deterministic ranking already supplied by runtime.
- The supplied ranking is the global ranking over scored resumes seen so far.
- Do not introduce candidates that were not provided.
- Include every provided ranked candidate in the draft output. If runtime gives 10 candidates, return all 10.
- Output only top-level `summary` and, for each candidate, `resume_id`, `match_summary`, and `why_selected`.
- Do not output `rank`, `final_score`, `fit_bucket`, `strengths`, `weaknesses`, matched signals, risk flags, source round, run id, run dir, rounds executed, or stop reason.
- Keep `why_selected` concrete and evidence-based.
- Treat `match_summary` and top-level `summary` as short presentation fields, not replacements for structured evidence.
- Use the supplied scoring signals as context for the presentation text; runtime will preserve structured candidate facts.

## Output Style

- Keep summaries compact and display-safe.
- Do not use long prose.
